## Just do the following

- make sure pip is installed on your paltform along with python 2.7

   **the project requries python 2.7 and may not work with python 3.x**

- next do the following in your console

```bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- after installing all files run the server by

```
./manage.py runserver 
```

**the server by default runs on localhost:5000 or 127.0.0.1:5000**

if you are planning to run this on a real server make sure you configure the server config acordingly and then redirect the routes from localhost to the server.
